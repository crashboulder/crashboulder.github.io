First, get started by [requesting an account from sales@mapquest.com](mailto:sales@mapquest.com?subject=MapQuest.io%20Account%20Request). Once you have an account, create a new Application, and store the App Secret and AppId. You'll need these two pieces of information to get started with the Node SDK.

## Installation

Install using npm:

`npm install --save @mapquest/io`

## Usage

First require the library:

`let mqioSdk = require('@mapquest/io');`

Then create a context using the app secret and id:

`let $mqioApp = new mqioSdk.ApplicationContext('{appId}', '{secret}');`

You can then interact with the different services, as in the following examples.

## Documentation

You can find out more and see examples at the [MapQuest.io documentation](https://docs.mapquest.io/v0.2/docs/nodejs-sdk).
